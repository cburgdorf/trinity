Upgrade latest lahja 0.16.0

With the new release the event bus raises exceptions if events or requests
are send into the void, meaning when no active subscribers exist. This can
be explicitly allowed if desired by setting ``require_subscriber`` to ``False``
when broadcasting events or making requests.
