Trinity on DappNode:

- Ensure the package uses the timezone of the host machine.
  This is to ensure the reported logs use the correct time and match the reported metrics.

- Allow HTTP requests from external addresses. This ensures the DappNode dashboard can
  show syncing progress and users can perform requests against the node. Note that the
  DappNode itself is shielded from the external world and only allows access via VPN or
  its own local W-LAN.

- Don't map Trinity's source directory as volume because it is preventing us from having clean
  updates.
