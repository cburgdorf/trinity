Implement basic metrics tracking. With this change Trinity supports collecting
and writing metrics to InfluxDB to be further processed and visualized
by Grafana.

Run Trinity with ``--enable-metrics --metrics-host "mymachine"`` and provide
the Influx server and password via the following two environment variables:

- ``TRINITY_METRICS_INFLUX_DB_SERVER``
- ``TRINITY_METRICS_INFLUX_DB_PW``
